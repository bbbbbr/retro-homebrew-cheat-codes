# Adding Entries
To submit a game or program, either :
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/bbbbbr/retro-homebrew-cheat-codes/issues)
- Or edit the JSON data and open a Pull Request
  - The [Entry Formatter](https://bbbbbr.github.io/retro-homebrew-cheat-codes/entry_formatter.html) is recommended


# Why?
Some ideal criteria for a site hosting homebrew cheat and secret code data could be:
- A site where the content is ok/encouraged to be copied and used elsewhere, not run or owned by an entity that might exert restrictions or copyright over content
- Having the data in a form that is easy to export and use elsewhere
- Having a low barrier to entry such that homebrew games even with a very small audience or player based wouldn't get rejected as not meriting inclusion
- Preferably filterable to homebrew/indie only

Having not found other sites which meet that criteria, this is an experiment to do so.

The idea for this came from a discussion on npckc's post about their and chunderfins [Indie Game Cheats Zine](https://npckc.itch.io/indie-game-cheats).
